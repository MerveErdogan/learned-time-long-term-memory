# Are overwritten associations deleted?

The mainstream learning theories claim that after a reward-expcted time is learned if the reward constantly comes at a diffferent time, the current time is overwritten on the previous one. Therefore, the previously learned-time as the reward moment is removed from the memory. 

The main study investigates that whether this memory of a reward-expected time point is deleted completely or it is stored in the long term memory and get activated with the extinction of the reward in the current reward-expected time. For this purpose, the mices participate an FIPI task in which they get a reward after a certain time (15 sec in a group, 30 sec in the other group). After the mices learned the time as the reward coming moment, the reward moment in the Fixed-interval trials of the FIPI task is changed to a different time (30 for the 1st group, 15 for the 2nd group). At the end of learning the second duration, the extinction phase starts in which the mices do not get any reward. It is expected that in the absence of a reward at that time point, mices seek for the reward at the previous time point meaning that previously learned reward-expected time is kept in the long term memory. 

There are two groups. One is given a reward in a shorter duration and the longer reward-expected time is overwritten to the short one. and for the other group is vice versa.
The reason for this, the mechanism may be different by depending on whether the overwritten time includes the previous one or not.
